# Chess
This project was made using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
A simple chess game using the [Stockfish.js](https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js) for computer moves.
# Future Updates
* A back button to undo moves or move the game back to a previous position
* A hint button to use Stockfish to show the best move for a given position
* A New Game button to reset the game
